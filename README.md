# content_author_tool

Developed in Java 1.8 using the JavaFX library.

This author tool is a text editor that facilitates the process of creating and analyzing content for web usage. 

I created this application to help content writers improve their overall productivity. The more content / articles a freelance writer or content creation business is able to produce, the more revenue they will generate. In writing freelance content for businesses around the world, I found that I spent too much time manually tracking keyword count and density, the reading grade level of the content, and the total cost that I should bill my clients. This application eliminates the need to track content data separately, as everything can be calculated within the tool with the click a button. As a result, the content writer spends less time tracking metrics, and more time producing more content and generating more revenue.

This content author tool offers the following functionality to the end-user:

- text editor
- keyword tracker (calculates count and density for identified keywords)
- word count calculator
- cost calculator
- reading grade level calculator
- save functionality (.doc or .txt) with article title, META title, META description, article content, and all metrics displayed in an easy-to-read format
